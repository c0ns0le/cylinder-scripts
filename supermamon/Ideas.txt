* FlightBoard
	Random vertical icon flips. Split by row. Like an airport flightboard
* Bomb 
	First icon will drop to the center and explode other icons.
* Zipper
	Split progressively in the center of the screen. Vertical/Horizontal
* Burn
	Expanding hole from the center going outwards
* Fallen Icons
	Drop the icons quickly to the bottom. 
	Randomly move them like fallen leaves blown away by a fast moving car
* Milky Way
	Form a spiral. Then rotate it.
